# Nomadic Herders and Weather Risk

Authors: Giovanni Corti, Wenxin Du and Ilana Heaton

We plan to map usage of the Mercy Corps Mongolia LTS-2 project's SMS platform at a general and individual level during the year, and to determine what factors might explain usage patterns.

Summary: 
    The goal of this project is to understand how usage of the SMS services distributed over time and space between June 2016 and July 2017. Our analysis focused on three areas: 1) Individual User Profiles, 2) Usage Over Time, and 3) Spacial Distribution of Usage. Our findings would be presented in the form of a white paper that can be found in Documents folder, along with an interactive shiny dashboard that displays the distribution of usage for each area codes.
